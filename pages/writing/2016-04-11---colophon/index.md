**The full source code for the site is available on [Github](https://github.com/kylegach/kylegach_com).** {.mb-3 .p-2 .bgDarker-1}

This site is built using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/), a fantastic little static site generator powered by [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

It is styled using [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and the [cssnext](http://cssnext.io/) plugin, which allows me to use all sorts of cool future CSS right now. I based my styling system heavily on [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/), which is one of the most inspiring and mind-expanding things I’ve ever come across in this industry^[Some of the others are Ethan Marcotte’s explosive introduction to [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), John Allsopp’s timeless [A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao), Nicolas Gallagher’s sage [About HTML Semantics and Front-end Architecture](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/), and Frank Chimero’s beautifully articulated [What Screens Want](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/what-screens-want/) &amp; [The Web’s Grain](http://www.frankchimero.com/writing/the-webs-grain)]. I made two significant deviations from Basscss: 1) adopting Harry Roberts’ [clever syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/#responsive-suffixes) for responsive suffixes, and 2) trying to adhere to a `propertyName-value` structure in the class names for consistency.

The words are typeset with the following font stack, which defaults to your system’s font, if available:

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, Segoe UI, Roboto, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif;
```

Headings are set in [League Spartan](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-spartan).

All of the SVG animations are powered by [Greensock](https://greensock.com/gsap), and I could not have built them without the excellent knowledge shared by [Sara Soueidan](https://sarasoueidan.com/tags/svg/) and [Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/) (for the nifty line drawing effect).

The “lights off” mode after sunset is inspired by Liz Danzico’s [Evening Edition](http://bobulate.com/post/1216102383/evening-edition), [Twitterrific’s](http://twitterrific.com/ios) beautiful dark theme, and an everlasting disdain for bright white screens at night.
